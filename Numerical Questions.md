1. There is a train 340m in length running at 45km/hr....how long will it take to cross a tunnel of length :  160m?
	
	    - To find out how long it will take for the train to completely cross a tunnel, including its own length and the tunnel's length, you can follow these steps:
	
	    1. Calculate the total distance the train needs to cover to cross both the tunnel and its own length.
	
	    2. Determine the speed of the train in meters per second (m/s).
	
	    3. Use the formula: time = distance / speed to find the time it takes for the train to cross.
	
	    Let's break down each step:
	
	    1. Calculate the total distance:
	    - Length of the train = 340 meters
	    - Length of the tunnel = 160 meters
	    - So, the total distance to be covered = 340 meters (train length) + 160 meters (tunnel length) = 500 meters
	
	    2. Convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per second (m/s). To do this, you need to know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.
	    - Speed of the train = 45 km/hr
	    - Speed in m/s = (45 * 1000) / 3600 = 12.5 m/s
	
	    3. Now, use the formula time = distance / speed to calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the tunnel:
	    - Time = (Total distance) / (Speed of the train)
	    - Time = 500 meters / 12.5 m/s = 40 seconds
	
	    So, it will take the train 40 seconds to completely cross the tunnel, including its own length.
